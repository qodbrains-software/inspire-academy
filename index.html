                            We provide extra lessons for both Maths and Physical Sciences, which includes one-on-one lessons to make
                            sure that you are learning at your own speed - unlike in a class where you can get left behind. Here at
                            Inspire Academy we use this textbook "Maths Simplified (CAPS)", which breaks down the whole curriculum,
                            in the simplest way possible. One of our students prized students often refers to it as "Maths for
                            Dummies" because it helps explain all the difficult topics that you may encounter. It also contains Exam
                            questions so that you can be ready for the standard that will be given in the exams.
